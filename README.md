## Overview

This website is mobile responsive. It is a 4 page website. Unit testing was done for each component. It shows my ability to build a fully functional website with React, typescript, and SCSS

- The user pages should pull data from a mock api with 500 records
- Use local storage or indexedDB to store and retrieve user details on the user details page.
- The page must be mobile responsive

### What I learned

This project has taught me a lot, especially the use of typescript in React. Also broaden my understanding of unit testing

### Useful resources
